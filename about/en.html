    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>My name is Marcos Iván Miranda García, and I'm 24 years old. <br/>I was born, and currently live in,
        Managua, Nicaragua. <img src="/assets/flags/blank.gif" class="flag flag-ni" /></p>
    <p>I studied Computer Engineering at the National University of Engineering 
        (Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería - UNI), and I specialize in the development 
        of games, mobile apps and websites (like this one!).</p>
    <p>My greatest interest (and passion) are videogames, 
        be it playing them, or making them.
        Sadly, there isn't an established videogame industry in my country.
        So, I make my own games. 
        <!--Also, since I don't like starving, I work as.-->
        I also make websites when I have the chance, which rarely happens.</p>
    <p>Among my favorite things is learning new things.<br/>
        And among my favorite things to learn are languages.</p>
    <p>
        Speaking of which, my native language is Spanish,
        but as you can see, I'm also fluent in English.

        今僕は日本語を勉強しにいる。
        僕のレベルはN５けど、まだN５の試験をしてない。
        <span class="tooltiptext">Right now, I'm studying Japanese. 
            My current level is N5, but I haven't yet taken the official N5 test.</span>

    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>
        This site is made with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, 
        a static site generator written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>.
        Jekyll supports a variety of themes, and the one I'm currently using
        is called <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker">Hacker</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose this platform because I'm not very good (I suck, to be honest) at designing 
        user interfaces from nothing, be it apps or websites. It's a subjective thing, 
        and I have more of a knack for objective things, like if code works as intended or not.
        Of course, I want to get better, and I'm always trying to get better. <br/> 
        So, in my never-ending quest in learning new things, I made this site, so I can
        play around and have fun, while I learn about good design practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        This isn't just my personal website, it's also my portfolio site.
        But I don't want it to be yet another boring portfolio site. 
        I want to show who I am and my weird personality.
        I want to show I like to have fun and to not take everything too seriously,
        but when it's time to work, I'm very reliable and responsible.
        But of course I'd say that, right? ;)
